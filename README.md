Solve the diffusion-reaction equations with custom initial conditions. Used to create our profile logo.

# Getting Started
To make your own gif, first pull DiffusionReaction from git. Then, set up the dependencies by running 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt`
```

Finally, run the program by typing 

```
python rd_image.py -f path/to/image.png
```

into your terminal. This will produce a file named output.gif in the same directory.

To see a list of options that can be tweaked to generate different images, try doing:

```
python rd_image.py --help
```
